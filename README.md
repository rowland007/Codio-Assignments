### Codio Code Challenges
The Codio environment was used to engage in activities that helped build skills and a knowledge base. The activities are embedded within the unit. 
The activities in Codio are designed in a procedural manner. As a result of this design, there is possibility to encounter challenges that have dependencies on work done in the activities in earlier sections. Complete the entire Codio unit in sequence to avoid any dependency issues.
